# Sencore-IB to USB PCB

This is an Altium-based PCB project for a Sencore-IB to USB clone.


# Defects

Some defects have been noticed on this PCB revision:

1. The selected isolated DC-DC converter is unregulated. This would fry the secondary circuits. A suggested fix it to use an ADUM5000/ADuM5010/ADuM5020.
2. Some silkscreens are not in the proper place.
